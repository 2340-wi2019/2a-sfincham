<h1>The Wizard of Oz!</h1>
<p> 
    <strong><span data-id="femaleName1"></span></strong> lived in the midst of the great <strong><span data-id="stateName"></span></strong> <strong><span data-id="geoFeature"></span></strong> , with Uncle <strong><span data-id="maleName"></span></strong> , who was a <strong><span data-id="jobName"></span></strong> , and Aunt <strong><span data-id="femaleName2"></span></strong>, who was the farmer's wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking <strong><span data-id="noun1"></span></strong>, a <strong><span data-id="noun2"></span></strong> for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle <strong><span data-id="maleName"></span></strong> and Aunt <strong><span data-id="femaleName2"></span></strong> had a big bed in one corner, and <strong><span data-id="femaleName1"></span></strong>a little bed in another corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar--except a small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family would go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap door in the middle of the <strong><span data-id="noun3"></span></strong>, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark hole.

</p>

<p>When <strong><span data-id="femaleName1"></span></strong> stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing but the great <strong><span data-id="colorName"></span></strong> <strong><span data-id="geoFeature"></span></strong> on every side. Not a <strong><span data-id="noun4"></span></strong> nor a <strong><span data-id="noun5"></span></strong> broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a <strong><span data-id="colorName"></span></strong> mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same <strong><span data-id="colorName"></span></strong> color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rain washed it away, and now the house was as dull and <strong><span data-id="colorName"></span></strong> as everything else.
